# Backend API for my personal portfolio

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/KevinRaleie-dev/portfolio-backend/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

I am looking into using this as a way to feed data to my client side application, as a way to avoid doing everything client side. Using it as a kind of CMS and hopefully it'll grow into more of a backend service as i continue developing it. ü§ûüèΩ
